1. Given a valid sentence without any spaces between the words and a dictionary 
of valid English words, find all possible ways to break the sentence in
individual dictionary words.

Ex. 
Consider the following dictionary 
{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, 
  cream, icecream, man, go, mango}

Input: "ilikesamsungmobile"
Output: i like sam sung mobile
        i like samsung mobile

Input: "ilikeicecreamandmango"
Output: i like ice cream and man go
        i like ice cream and mango
        i like icecream and man go
        i like icecream and mango

public void wordBreakUtil(String str, ArrayList<String> dictionary) 
{ 


}

2. Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times 
[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

}



3. Find the edit distance of 2 strings. Edit distance is the minimum number of 
operations required to convert str1 to str2. The 3 operations you can perform
are insert, remove, and replace.

Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by inserting a 's'.

Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.

Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
Output:  3
Last three and first characters are same.  We basically
need to convert "un" to "atur".  This can be done using
below three operations. 
Replace 'n' with 'r', insert t, insert a


public int editDist(String str1 , String str2 , int m ,int n) 
{ 


4. Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. For example, if length of the rod is 8 and the values of different pieces are given as following, then the maximum obtainable value is 22 (by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 6)


length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20

And if the prices are as following, then the maximum obtainable value is 24 (by cutting in eight pieces of length 1)

length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 3   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
