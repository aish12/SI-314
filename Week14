1. Given a valid sentence without any spaces between the words and a dictionary 
of valid English words, find all possible ways to break the sentence in
individual dictionary words.

Ex. 
Consider the following dictionary 
{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, 
  cream, icecream, man, go, mango}

Input: "ilikesamsungmobile"
Output: i like sam sung mobile
        i like samsung mobile

Input: "ilikeicecreamandmango"
Output: i like ice cream and man go
        i like ice cream and mango
        i like icecream and man go
        i like icecream and mango

public void wordBreakUtil(String str, ArrayList<String> dictionary) 
{ 


}

2. Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times 
[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

}



3. Find the edit distance of 2 strings. Edit distance is the minimum number of 
operations required to convert str1 to str2. The 3 operations you can perform
are insert, remove, and replace.

Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by inserting a 's'.

Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.

Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
Output:  3
Last three and first characters are same.  We basically
need to convert "un" to "atur".  This can be done using
below three operations. 
Replace 'n' with 'r', insert t, insert a


public int editDist(String str1 , String str2 , int m ,int n) 
{
