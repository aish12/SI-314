1. What is an interface?
2. What is an API?

3. Suppose you have written a time server which periodically 
notifies its clients of the current date and time. Write an interface
that the server could use to enforce a particular protocol on it's clients. 

4. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that
they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have
exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You must
implement the fastest solution. 

public static (int[] data, int sum) {

}

5. You are writing a program that represents a map on a website. When
someone reaches the website, they should be able to enter a location on the 
map where they have been. The website will update with a representation of the 
number of people who said they have been to a particular spot. They will enter
their name along with it. The map should show countries, states, and cities. 
When you click on a spot on the map, it should show you a list of who has been 
there. 
Design interfaces/API's to model this website. 

6. 
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it
while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function,
nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations
