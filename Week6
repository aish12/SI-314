1. What are the Big-O's of the following methods in a singly linked list?
- addLast
- addFirst
- insert
- remove (index)
- removeFront
- removeBack

2. Partner up: exercise with how insert works with a linked list

3. Assume you have a linked list which is sorted. Write the binarySearch method for linkedList. 
Recall you are searching for the first index at which tgt occurs
public int binarySearch(E tgt) {

}

4. Write an instance method removeMiddle for the LinkedList class. Assume you have a singlyLinked list

public void removeMiddle() {

}

5. What are the 4 steps you need to keep in mind while programming recursive methods?

6. Write a recursive method to compute the nth fibonacci number. Draw the stack associated with how your program is run
The nth fibonacci number is computer by taking the sum of the previous 2 recursive numbers
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5
fib(6) = 8
fib(7) = 13
