Draft a class system that models the United States Social Security System.

Write a method that determines if a number is prime. How can you make this more efficient?

Suppose you have a database of sensitive information. Many people have
access to some parts of the database. Suppose I have access to data in 
California. I create a chart based on this information. Suppose I allow 
this chart to be shared because it doesnâ€™t have any directly unsafe
information. I should be able to share this with another person. On the
other hand, suppose I create a chart and it does have sensitive information
in it. If I send it to the other person, they should be able to see the
chart with their data. How can we build a database that will accomplish this?
Assume you have a file with each person and their clearance level, and another file 
which has each row of data and its clearance level.

Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
