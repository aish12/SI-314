3. You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
   Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only 
   constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that 
   adjacent houses have security system connected and it will
   automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were
   broken into on the same night.

   Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount
   of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money 
   you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

   public int rob(int[] nums) {
      
   }
