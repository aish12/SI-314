1. Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

2. Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the input, 
tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is
no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

3. 
We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its
direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the
smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids
moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example 1:
Input: 
asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: 
The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.
Example 2:
Input: 
asteroids = [8, -8]
Output: []
Explanation: 
The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
Example 3:
Input: 
asteroids = [10, 2, -5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: 
The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5.  The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
Example 4:
Input: 
asteroids = [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Output: [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Explanation: 
The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right.
Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.
Note:

The length of asteroids will be at most 10000.
Each asteroid will be a non-zero integer in the range [-1000, 1000].

4. Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.

We define super digit of an integer x using the following rules:

If x has only  1 digit, then its super digit is x.
Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the digit-sum of x. 
Here, digit-sum of a number is defined as the sum of its digits.
For example, super digit of 9875 will be calculated as:

super_digit(9875) = super_digit(9+8+7+5) 
                  = super_digit(29) 
                  = super_digit(2+9)
                  = super_digit(11)
                  = super_digit(1+1)
                  = super_digit(2)
                  = 2.
You are given two numbers n and k. You have to calculate the super digit of p.

p is created when number n is concatenated k times. That is, if n=123 and k=3, then p=123123123.

Input Format

The first line contains two space separated integers, n and k.

Constraints
n <= n <= 10^100,000
1 <= k <= 10^5

Output Format
Output the super digit of p, where p is created as described above.

Sample Input 0
148 3

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0

Here n=148 and k=3, so P=148148148.

super_digit(P) = super_digit(148148148) 
               = super_digit(1+4+8+1+4+8+1+4+8)
               = super_digit(39)
               = super_digit(3+9)
               = super_digit(12)
               = super_digit(1+2)
               = super_digit(3)
               = 3.
